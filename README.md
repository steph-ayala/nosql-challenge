Conclusion
In this project, we set up a MongoDB database to analyze the UK Food Standards Agency's food hygiene ratings. We successfully imported and validated the dataset, made necessary updates (such as adding a new restaurant and cleaning data), and performed exploratory analysis to answer key questions for the Eat Safe, Love magazine editors. By querying and aggregating data, we provided insights into establishments' hygiene scores, ratings, and locations to help guide future editorial decisions. This project demonstrates how to effectively use NoSQL databases for data management and analysis in real-world scenarios.
